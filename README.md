# Brackets
A helper function to a level 5 exam question.

Requirements
Write a program that takes an undefined number of strings in arguments. For each
argument, the program prints on the standard output "OK" followed by a newline
if the expression is correctly bracketed, otherwise it prints "Error" followed by
a newline.

Symbols considered as 'brackets' are brackets '(' and ')', square brackets '['
and ']'and braces '{' and '}'. Every other symbols are simply ignored.

An opening bracket must always be closed by the good closing bracket in the
correct order. A string which not contains any bracket is considered as a
correctly bracketed string.
If there is no arguments, the program must print only a newline.
